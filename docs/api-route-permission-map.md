# API Route Permission Map

Working baseline for turning the current API surface into a role-governed product.

Source files:

- `routes/*.js`
- `server.js` for `/api/health` only
- `docs/api-registry.md`
- `docs/permission-registry.md`
- `IronBend_API_Registry.docx`
- `IronBend_Permission_Matrix.docx`

## Current Code Snapshot

Automated scan of active API sources found:

- `server.js` intentionally keeps only `GET /api/health`.
- Product API route families live in module-owned `routes/*.js` files.
- Public/scoped boundaries remain explicit by design: auth, customer portal, WhatsApp webhook, OCR custom authorization, and health.
- `test/route-auth-coverage.test.js` fails if a new active `/api/*` route is added without an explicit role guard, custom authorization middleware, scoped public boundary, or allowlist entry.

Directly protected route groups today:

| Group | Routes | Current middleware |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings | `/api/settings`, `/api/settings/test/:service` | `requireRole('admin')` |

| Order commitments | `/api/orders/manual`, `/api/orders`, `/api/order-imports/preview`, `/api/order-imports/:id/approve`, `/api/intake/:id/approve`, `/api/intake/:id/reject` | `requireAnyRole(['office', 'manager', 'admin'])` |
| Order reads/documents | `/api/orders`, `/api/orders/:id`, `/api/orders/:id/print-cards`, `/api/orders/:id/print-a4`, `/api/orders/:id/delivery-certificate` | read: `office/production/sales/manager/admin`; documents by operational role |

| Order lifecycle | `/api/orders/:id/status` | `requireAnyRole(['office', 'production', 'manager', 'admin'])` |
| Order lock/ERP | `/api/orders/:id/lock`, `/api/orders/:id/unlock`, `/api/priority/sync/:orderId` | `requireRole('manager')` |
| Production setup/read | `/api/workers`, `/api/workers/:id`, `/api/machines`, `/api/machines/:id`, `/api/machines/:id/config`, `/api/machines/:id/state-log`, `/api/machines/oee` | reads use production/maintenance/office/manager/admin by data surface; setup writes use manager/admin |
| Production station actions | `/api/machines/:id/send-params`, `/api/machines/:id/complete`, `/api/scan`, `/api/machines/:id/end-of-day`, `/api/items/:id/status` | `requireAnyRole(['production', 'kiosk', 'manager', 'admin'])` |
| Production assignment/state | `/api/machines/:id/assign`, `/api/machines/:id/state` | assignment: `production/manager/admin`; state: `production/maintenance/manager/admin` |
| Shifts and stops | `/api/shifts`, `/api/shifts/:id/end`, `/api/machine-stops`, `/api/machine-stops/:id/end` | `production/manager/admin` or `production/maintenance/manager/admin` |

Current guard behavior: `requireRole()` and `requireAnyRole()` require real JWT-derived `req.auth` and do not trust `x-user-role`/`x-user-id` browser headers. Route coverage is guarded by `test/route-auth-coverage.test.js`; request-level tests still need to keep expanding for every critical workflow.

## Target Role Baseline

Use the original permission matrix roles as the product baseline until the role reconciliation decision is complete:

| Role | Level | Intended scope |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `admin` | 100 | System ownership, users, database, all modules |
| `manager` | 90 | Operational management, approvals, financial oversight |
| `office` | 70 | Orders, customers, pricing, documents, day-to-day administration |
| `production` | 50 | Production queue, machine execution, scan, shift work |
| `quality` | 50 | Incidents, NCR, CAPA, inspections |
| `maintenance` | 50 | Maintenance, LOTO, PM schedule, machine stops |
| `driver` | 30 | Deliveries, route status, delivery confirmations |
| `warehouse` | 30 | Inventory, receiving, packages, delivery notes |
| `sales` | 20 | Customer/order visibility, quotes, pricing read access |
| `viewer` | 10 | Read-only dashboards and reports |
| `kiosk` | 15 | Narrow production station actions |

Current code-only roles that need reconciliation:

- `operator`
- `finance`
- `customer`
- `supplier`

## Permission Rules

| Rule | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Health endpoints | Public only when they reveal no sensitive data. |
| Customer portal `/api/c/*` | Customer-scoped auth, not internal role auth. |
| Auth endpoints | Public for login/refresh only; logout should require a valid refresh/access context. |
| Internal API reads | Require at least authenticated role unless explicitly public. |
| Internal API writes | Require module owner role or higher. |
| Approval, lock, cancel, pay, credit, pricing | Require manager/office/finance/admin according to final role reconciliation. |
| Database upload/download, user management, settings | Admin-only. |
| Audit log | Admin/manager read-only; no public access. |
| Exports and reports | Authenticated; finance/business exports require manager/office/finance/admin. |

## Sprint 1 Implementation Order

1. Freeze the target role list and map current code roles to the permission matrix.
2. Keep `JWT_SECRET` configured in every deployed environment.
3. Keep `test/route-auth-coverage.test.js` green so no active `/api/*` route can be added without a guard or explicit public/scoped boundary.
4. Protect P0 families first: users, settings, admin database, finance/credit, order approvals, production queue mutations, customer portal ownership.
5. Add route-level tests for every P0 family before broad refactors.
6. Keep route families inside module-owned `routes/*.js` files; new routes require explicit permission contracts and `test/module-governance.test.js` updates.

## Acceptance Checks

- Every non-public route declares auth and role policy in code.
- Tests prove anonymous access fails for all internal P0/P1 families.
- Tests prove low-level roles cannot perform manager/admin actions.
- Customer portal tests prove OTP is required before phone bootstrap token issue, token rotate/revoke invalidates old links, unauthenticated order creation is rejected, and a customer cannot read or mutate another customer's orders.
- Settings and database routes cannot be accessed through spoofed headers.
