# Entity Registry

Source-of-truth registry required by Volume 10. Current entities are inferred
from SQLite table creation in `server.js` and `auth-core.js`. This registry is
the first planning-level ownership map; it is not yet a full schema dictionary.

The original `IronBend_Entity_Registry.docx` defines 46 business entities. This
markdown registry includes those entities plus implementation extensions found
in the current codebase, such as auth/session and import-staging tables.

## Platform Core

| `refresh_tokens` | Platform Core | Implementation extension. Created by `auth-core.js`; rotating refresh token storage. |
| `settings` | Platform Core | Stores service configuration/secrets; admin-only. |
| `audit_log` | Platform Core | Partial audit trail; should become universal important-action ledger. |
| `alerts` | Platform Core / Dashboard | Global alerts and contextual alerts. |
| `companies` | Platform Core / Multi-tenant | Current company/holding basis; future tenant boundary. |

## Entity Cleanup Decisions Needed

1. Decide whether `credit_accounts` or `customer_credit` is authoritative for
   credit limit/payment terms.
2. Define whether `items` belongs primarily to Orders or Production and what
   fields each module may mutate.
3. Move portal access out of `customers.portal_token` or harden its lifecycle.
4. Define tenant/company boundary before selling to multiple customers.
5. Replace schema-on-startup changes with a migration framework before serious
   commercial deployments.
